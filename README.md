Data Science

By the end of this project, you will be able to deal with time-series data generated from smart IoT devices, Analyze the weather influence on electricity consumption, and apply a regression model using Scikit-learn to predict the electricity consumption of a building If provided with some information like temperature, humidity and so on. 

Note: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. Weâ€™re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.

You will be able to identify data science applications in engineering projects as well as Import libraries and helper functions

import the building dataset based on geographical location and usage

Asses the data for quality and tidiness issues.

Clean the data

Normalize the data

Create Train and Test datasets

Create the prediction model
